# Machine_learning_project_parkisons_classification

This notebook performs Parkinsonâ€™s disease classification using machine learning. It visualizes relationships between features, splits the data for training and testing, and builds a predictive model using PyCaret. A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model is tuned and evaluated with metrics like AUC and confusion matrix, then used to predict outcomes on unseen data.
